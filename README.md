## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which provides the `start`, `test`, and `build` scripts.

### `npm start`

Runs the app locally, available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), in watch mode. All linting and Typescript errors will log to the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, ready for [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run lint`

Runs linting checks directly. Note that this already logs to the console in development as well as during a build, and is meant primarily for flexible usage options with CI.
